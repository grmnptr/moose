# InverseMapping

!syntax description /UserObjects/InverseMapping

## Overview

This object is responsible for mapping the solution coordinates in a low-dimensional
latent space into high-dimensional MOOSE solution vectors. For this, we need a mapping object which can be
defined using the [!param](/UserObjects/InverseMapping/mapping) input parameter.
The method populates `AuxVariables` with the approximated high-order solution vectors. The user can specify the
`AuxVariables` using [!param](/UserObjects/InverseMapping/variable_to_fill). At the same time, to be able to identify the DoF connections between the basis functions in the mapping and the auxiliary variable,
this object expects the user to input the real variable name as well using the [!param](/UserObjects/InverseMapping/variable_to_reconstruct) parameter. This object can function in two distinct ways:

1. If [!param](/UserObjects/InverseMapping/surrogate) is supplied, we use a surrogate model to
   generate the coordinates in the latent space (e.g. [PolynomialRegressionSurrogate.md]). In this case
   the [!param](/UserObjects/InverseMapping/parameters) input parameter refers to the model parameters
   (created using a [Sampler](Samplers/index.md) or manually). One can define different surrogates for different variables.
2. If no surrogate is supplied, we assume that the user supplies the coordinates in the low-dimensional space using
   the [!param](/UserObjects/InverseMapping/parameters) input parameter.
